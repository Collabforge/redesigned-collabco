<h2>Featured Co-Labs</h2>

<p>Not all ideas remain ideas. Those that find the right formula gain support and get noticed! Ideas ready to take the next leap will enter the ‘develop’ cycle in the innovation process. Once an idea is selected, it will go through cycles of User testing > Iteration and Refinement > Rapid prototyping. </p>

<p>This is where ideas are allocated a sponsor, dedicated resources and time to determine whether the idea is likely to be successful if implemented and what value the idea will deliver.
