COLLABCO_SEARCH
===============

This module produces an additional "Members" tab on the /search page, if so
configured on the /admin/config/search/settings page.

For privacy reasons members' email addresses are searched and shown only when
the viewer is logged in with "administer users" permission.
This is consistent with core's User search.
